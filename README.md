# Ancient Egypt CTFd Theme

This is a custom Ancient Egyptian-themed user interface for [CTFd](https://github.com/CTFd/CTFd), designed for a Capture The Flag event collaboratively built by four LIA (internship) students as part of our thesis project. The CTF was designed to engage students with IT backgrounds, although all were welcome to participate. The theme was fully designed and implemented by me and tested with CTFd version **3.7.6**.

## üé® Overview

This theme transforms the default CTFd interface into a stylized, immersive Ancient Egyptian experience. Visual elements, music, and layout were carefully modified to create a unique and memorable learning environment. Key UI areas like the challenge board, team rankings, user stats, and authentication pages were redesigned.

**Highlights:**

- Custom backgrounds and visuals for all major pages.
- Background music toggle on the challenges page, featuring *"Flavor Cats"* from the *Age of Mythology* soundtrack.
- AI-generated imagery for page backgrounds and icons.
- Optional ancient-inspired favicon and logo support.
